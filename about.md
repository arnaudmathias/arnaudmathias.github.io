Hi, I'm Arnaud Mathias.
I spend much of my spare time working on graphics-related side projects. The main goal of this website is to force myself to keep those projects documented.  
Any question, shoot me an email at **arndmathias@gmail.com**


Most of my projects can be found of my [GitHub](https://github.com/arnaudmathias)
