Hi, I'm Arnaud Mathias. I'm a [42](https://42.fr) student, mainly interested in Graphics (OpenGL, Vulkan), and GPGPU (OpenCL).
The goal of this website is to force myself to keep my personal projects documented.  
Any question, shoot me an email at **arndmathias@gmail.com**


Most of my projects can be found of my [GitHub](https://github.com/indiedriver)
