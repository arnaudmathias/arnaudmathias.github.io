ShaderPixel is a school project aimed at combining raymarching/raytracing with traditional rasterization.

I had to to implement many fragment shaders including some 3D fractals:
- Mandelbox
- Mandeltetra
- Mandelbulb
- Mengersponge

And some special effects or rendering technique such as:
- Volumetric light
- Volumetric fog

Every shader can take another fragment shader as input (similarly as how ShaderToy handle channels).
